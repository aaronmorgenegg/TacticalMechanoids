Adds 7 new types of mechanoids to the game, with an emphasis on mechanoids with unique supportive, offensive, and defensive traits.

Mechanoids:

Belcher:
	- Description

	- Attacks
		- AOE toxic sludge attack that does no regular damage, but adds toxic exposure, chance of disease/higher infection chances, and slows movement.
	- Special
		- Toxic damage and movement speed slow. Disassembles into steel, chemfuel, and neutroamine. Spills sludge on death.

Mechanite Drone:
	- Description
		- A simple repair bot that hosts a swarm of constructive mechanites that heal nearby mechanoids. Fragile on its own, but quite effective effective in long engagements, especially if protected by other mechanoids.

Spider drone(name?):
	- Idea: a small mechanical spider mechanoid. Fragile, fast, weak melee dps. One death, the legs continue fighting as slow-moving, fragile inchworm mechanoids. Designed to swarm, trigger traps, and distract.
		- Can curl up into a ball and be used as a mortar shell for mechanoid mortars?

Infiltrator:
	- Idea: an above-average colonist joins, soon has a mental break where it disables the power grid, hacks turrets/defenses, and starts attacking from within. Turns into an infiltrator mech when pawn is damaged. Triggers a mech raid when this happens.
		- Possibly can go invisible?

Acid mech(name?): 
	- Idea: Short ranged, wide area acid sprayer designed to kill insectoids, used as DPS, sapper, and to melt armor.

Mech Mortar(Name?)
	- A turret in mechanoid clusters that fires other mechanoids at you. Like a regular mortar that also spawns a weak melee mechanoid.

Suicide mech
	- Simple, a small, squishy, fast moving mech loaded with explosives that blows up on death. Fire damage, so doesn't really effect friendly mechanoids.

Events:

Research Team: Researcher/s are fleeing from a nearby mechanoid hive after recovering a hi-tech archotech/mechanoid artifact. They ask for protection and an energy source while they research the artifact, and offer to share their discoveries and technology once they are safe from the mechanoids.
	- Protect the research team from multiple waves of mechanoids. The research team will periodically draw high amounts of power from your base for their research.
	- Reward: mechanoid or archotech items, research
	- Alternative: kill the scientists and steal their artifact, research it yourself at your own pace.

Spider drone(name?):
	- Idea: a small mechanical spider mechanoid. Fragile, fast, weak melee dps. One death, the legs continue fighting as slow-moving, fragile inchworm mechanoids. Designed to swarm, trigger traps, and distract.

Infiltrator:
	- Idea: an above-average colonist joins, soon has a mental break where it disables the power grid, hacks turrets/defenses, and starts attacking from within. Turns into an infiltrator mech when pawn is damaged. Triggers a mech raid when this happens.

Acid mech(name?): 
	- Idea: Short ranged, wide area acid sprayer designed to kill insectoids, used as DPS, sapper, and to melt armor.

Excavator:
	- Idea: A big drill. Melee DPS, sapper, and burrow raid like infestations but with mechs. + a combo infestation/mech raid?



Events:

Research Team: Researcher/s are fleeing from a nearby mechanoid hive after recovering a hi-tech archotech/mechanoid artifact. They ask for protection and an energy source while they research the artifact, and offer to share their discoveries and technology once they are safe from the mechanoids.
	- Protect the research team from multiple waves of mechanoids. The research team will periodically draw high amounts of power from your base for their research.
	- Reward: mechanoid or archotech items, research
	- Alternative: kill the scientists and steal their artifact, research it yourself at your own pace.

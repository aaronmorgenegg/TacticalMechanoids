Patchers to add mechanoids to mech cluster spawners: https://github.com/juanosarg/AlphaAnimals/blob/master/1.2/Patches/AlphaMechanoidsPatch.xml
Messages translate aren't working - nonmechanoid message is off - print TM_NonMech....etc.
	-Options menu looks funky too, might be related
Add good textures
add sounds
Add Dubs Hygiene compapibility - Toxic Sludge sets hygiene to 0, washing lowers ToxicSludge severity.
Hide Oracle behind ModLister.RoyaltyInstalled, or a royalty patch?
Make belcher only attack biological targets? Since it is useless against turrets. Low priority because the AOE is so big.
re-review your own code once it's gotten far enough. Modify sounds/descriptions/graphics/balance etc.
Add burrow-towards-ranged-attackers functionality to shredder
add butcher-human-corpses functionality to shredder
